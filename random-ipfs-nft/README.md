# Random-IPFS-NFT

This project has 2 folders:

- `frontend`: This folder contains the frontend part of our application written in [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- `smart-contracts`: This folder contains the smart contract and its deployment script written with the help of [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

This application basically mints a NFT (Non Fungible Token) from random of 3 images to the user address. User has to pay `mint price + gas fee` to mint the NFT. This currently works only on Goerli testnet.

You can also see the transactions and deployed smart contract [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x31849D0F5Ac736cA4386245A42eD54F694dBc379).
